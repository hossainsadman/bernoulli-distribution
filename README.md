## Using Testing Infrastructure

### Pushing to Online Tester Repos

1. `git add remote gr10 https://github.com/ds-uot/ms2-group-10`
2. `git push gr10 <BRANCH>`

Note: 
- The online tester clones directly from `main` in the group-10 repo, so make sure to push to `main` in the group-10 repo
- Ideally this can be done by merging your branch to `main` in the `ece419` repo and then pushing to `main` in the group-10 repo
