    Automate the running of the given test cases Do regression testing, 
    make sure that relevant Milestone 1 tests still pass Test functionality such as create connection/disconnect,get/put value, update value (existing key), get non-existing key(check error messages)

    Add at least 10 test cases of your choice that cover the additional functionality and features of this milestone (e.g., ECS,consistent hashing, metadata updates, retry operations, locks ,etc.)

    Compile a short test report about all test cases, especially your own cases (submit as appendix of your design document).
